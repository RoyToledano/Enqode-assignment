# Enqode-assignment

## Part 1:
The given JavaScript code will output to the console the following result:
```
The element in position 5 is: undefined
The element in position 5 is: undefined
The element in position 5 is: undefined
The element in position 5 is: undefined
The element in position 5 is: undefined
```

**Explain:**
The variable 'i' is declared using 'var', which is function-scoped, not block-scoped. 
This means that 'var' does not create a new 'i' for each iteration of the loop. Instead, the same 'i' is shared across all iterations.
When the 'setTimeout' callback executes after 5 seconds, the for loop has already completed, and the value of 'i' has been incremented to the array's length, which is 5.
As a result, all the callbacks will see the final value of 'i', which is 5. Since there is no element at index 5 in the array, it prints undefined, because array[5] does not exist.
